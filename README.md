# SoapDispenserDriver
Arduino sketch to control the operation of a simple touchless soap dispenser.

This file is part of a junior year electrical engineering project to design a prototype product for production. Our team designed a pump for retail handsoap bottles which used
a proximity sensor and a servo to actuate the pump.
